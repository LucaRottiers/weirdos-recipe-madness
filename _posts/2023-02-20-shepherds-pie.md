Shepherd's pie is a traditional dish that originated in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is typically made with minced lamb, vegetables such as peas, carrots, and onions, and topped with a layer of mashed potatoes. The dish is usually baked in the oven until the top is crispy and golden brown. In some variations, beef is used instead of lamb, and the dish may be called "cottage pie." Shepherd's pie is a hearty, comforting meal that is often served in pubs and homes throughout the UK and Ireland.

## Preparation

Grate the onion, carrot and 2 cloves of garlic and set aside. Heat olive oil in a large pan. Season the minced lamb with salt and pepper.

---

Fry the minced lamb over medium-high heat for 4 - 5 minutes. Then mix in the grated onion, carrots and garlic with a wooden spoon.

---

Add Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste and the sprigs of rosemary and thyme. Cook for another 3 - 4 minutes, continuing to stir continuously in the meantime.

---

Pour in 240 ml of red wine and reduce until it is almost completely evaporated. Add chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Cook until lamb is thickened.

---

Taste, and add salt and pepper to taste. In the meantime, cook potatoes in the other large pan until tender. Drain the potatoes and strain through a fine sieve using a large (soup) spoon.

---

Then add 2 egg yolks along with the butter and milk and mix it all together smoothly. Mix in quite a bit of grated Parmesan cheese. Taste, and season with salt and pepper.

---

Preheat the oven to a temperature of 180 degrees Celsius.

Remove the sprigs of thyme and rosemary and divide the minced lamb into a baking dish. Try to distribute evenly, along the entire length of the dish. Then spoon a layer of mashed potatoes on top; you can use a wooden spoon to do this.

---

Cover the mashed potatoes with extra Parmesan cheese, using a fork to make nice mounds of it. Bake the shepherds pie in the oven for 20 minutes, or until nicely golden brown. Enjoy your meal!
