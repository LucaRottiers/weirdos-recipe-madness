## Preparation

### Stoofvlees

Peel and coarsely chop the onions.

---

Heat a large stewpot and melt a knob of butter in it. In it, stew the onions over medium heat. Do not let the onions brown.

---

Heat a skillet over medium to brisk heat, and melt a knob of butter in it.

---

Sear the pieces of meat in the skillet, until they have a golden brown crust. While frying, season the meat with some ground pepper and a pinch of salt. Note: It is best to fry a large quantity of meat in several turns. If the casserole is completely full of pieces of meat, it may lose too much moisture and 'cook' instead of frying.

---

Add the pieces of meat to the casserole with onions. Keep the skillet with the crusted meat and pour in the brown beer. Stir all the caking off the meat while the beer comes to the boil. (deglaze)

---

As soon as the beer boils, pour the entire contents of the pan into the stew with meat. (Never pour cold beer directly into the meat.) Tie a few bay leaves, a few sprigs of fresh thyme and a few parsley stalks together with an end of kitchen twine. Simmer the 'bouquet garni' in the pot.

---

Add the clove(s) and the apple-pear syrup.

---

Generously spread a large slice of brown bread with sharp mustard. (Feel free to use two small slices of bread as well.) Place the slice of bread in the pot, on top of the meat, smeared side down.

---

Let the stew meat simmer on a low heat for one and a half to three hours. There is no need to put the lid on the pot. The cooking time depends on the quality of the meat. Stir the pot once in a while and check in between to make sure the meat is sufficiently cooked.

---

Only once the stew meat sauce has the desired thickness, place the lid on the stew pot.

---

Finish the stew with a small dash of natural vinegar and stir everything around.

---

Taste and add some more ground pepper and a pinch of salt to taste.

### Chicory Salad

Rinse the chicory and drain well. Halve the chicory stalks and cut the tough heart out of the bottom of them. Then cut the stalks into very fine strips and put them in a mixing bowl.

---

Add some mayonnaise, but do not overdo it. It is enough when a thin layer of sauce sticks around the chicory pieces.

---

Season the salad with a dash of natural vinegar, some ground pepper and a pinch of salt. Gently mix the vegetables.

### Potato Fries

Peel the potatoes and cut them by hand into even-shaped fries. Do not wash the chips, as you will rinse off the starch.

---

Heat the frying fat to 140°C. Fry the fries a first time, but do not let them colour yet. Let the chips get cold in a bowl with some kitchen paper.

---

Then heat the frying fat to 180°C. Now fry the cold fries until golden brown and crispy.

---

Pour the chips back into a bowl with some kitchen paper, allowing them to drain for a while. Sprinkle with some salt to taste.

---

Serve a portion of stew with the freshly fried fries and a generous spoonful of mayonnaise.
