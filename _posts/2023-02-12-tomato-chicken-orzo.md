## Preparation

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celcius.

---

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet set over medium-high heat.

---

Rub the chicken with 1 tablespoon olive oil, the oregano, paprika, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, add the chicken. Sear on both sides until golden, about 3-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet.

---

To the same skillet, add the butter and shallot, cooking until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and orzo, cooking until lightly golden, 2-3 minutes.

---

Add the wine and de-glaze the pan. Add 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, cook 3-5 minutes, then add the cream, mustard, parmesan, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes, stirring until the spinach has wilted.

---

Slide the chicken and any juices left on the plate back into the skillet.

---

Transfer to the oven and cook, uncovered for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.

---

Serve the chicken topped with lemon juice and rosemary, if desired.
