##### Servings: 4

## Ingredients

| Ingredient             | Amount   |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| Olive oil              | 3tbsp    |
| Butter                 | 50g      |
| Garlic                 | 3 cloves |
| Cherry tomatoes        | 500g     |
| White wine             | 80ml     |
| Heavy cream            | 250ml    |
| Tortellini             | 500g     |
| Parmesan cheese        | 100g     |
| Fresh basil (optional) | 3 sprigs |

## Preparation

Warm the olive oil and butter in a large skillet on low-medium heat.

---

Add in the garlic and whole cherry tomatoes and let things simmer for about 8-10 minutes.

---

The cherry tomatoes will start to wilt a bit. Pour in the wine and heavy cream and gently press down on the cherry tomatoes in order to "pop them" aka, get their juices out into the sauce. (Things should turn a really pretty orange color when you stir.)

---

Add in salt and pepper, then stir and cover with a lid.

---

Let it simmer for about 15 minutes on low heat and then it's ready for the pasta! Cook the pasta according to the packet. Set this aside once it is almost al-dente.

---

Add the pasta to the sauce and finish with fresh basil. Enjoy!
