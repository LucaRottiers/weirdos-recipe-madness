## Preparation

In a large pot on medium heat, sauté onion, garlic, tomatoes, zucchini and chickpeas for a few minutes.

Pour in the orzo and water! You can start with 4 cups of water and then add 2 cups more if the orzo still isn’t tender.

---

Turn stove and medium high and stir every 30 seconds until all of the liquid is absorbed. When it’s almost done, add peas and spinach.

---

This should take about 10 minutes! Taste orzo when the liquid is absorbed and make sure it’s tender to your liking.

---

Season with salt pepper and Garlic.

Sprinkle on some parmesan cheese and enjoy!
