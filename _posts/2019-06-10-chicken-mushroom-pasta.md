## Preparation

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add chicken, salt and pepper, and brown - make sure to cook through. Set chicken aside.

---

Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion into the pot and stir. Cook down for 1-2 minutes.

---

Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to incorporate with the onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste as well as thyme and paprika. Stir to evenly season.

---

Add chicken broth and heavy cream to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then add the farfalle pasta.

---

Cook according to package instructions, being sure to stir every 1-2 minutes to keep the pasta from clumping together. (Cook time may be a little longer in this recipe than when the pasta is boiled in water.)

---

When the farfalle pasta is al dente, add the spinach and chicken and stir until the spinach cooks down and incorporates.

---

Add parmesan and stir until it’s well-incorporated and you’re left with a smooth sauce.

---

Top off with extra parmesan and serve.
